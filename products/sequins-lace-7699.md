description: "This is a glamorous sequin (sitara) lace featuring densely packed rows of shimmering metallic discs. The sequins are arranged in a uniform, edge-to-edge pattern that creates a dazzling, high-shine effect. With its neat, reinforced borders, this lace is durable and easy to stitch.
​It is an ideal choice for adding a rich, festive sparkle to designer sarees, lehengas, blouses, and dupattas."
